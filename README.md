# Llama 2 - 7B Chat GGML

This repository hosts the Llama 2 language model pre-trained on 7 billion conversations for chat-based tasks. The model is available on the Hugging Face Model Hub.

## Model Information

- **Model Name:** Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML
- **Author:** TheBloke
- **Hugging Face Model Hub:** [Llama 2 - 7B Chat GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML)

## Overview

Llama 2 is a powerful language model pre-trained on a diverse set of conversations to excel in chat-based tasks. This model is fine-tuned for general chat generation and can be used in various applications.

## How to Use

To use the Llama 2 model in your projects, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library. Here's an example of loading the model using Python:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

model_name = "TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
